          “Having someone do my organization felt decadent and hard to justify
          but boy am I glad that I got over that! Tammy Rydahl’s process forced
          me to look at what I had, and Tammy gave me the option of choosing how
          involved I wanted to be, which was very little. I work from home so
          that was helpful. What was more helpful was the end result. Who knew
          that organization could be so liberating and satisfying! She worked on
          my pantry, daughter’s room, living room and several garage areas. I
          also consulted with Tammy on another project and she inspired me to
          proceed with a challenging change in the house. I’m looking forward to
          more projects with Tammy and I have and I will recommend her without
          hesitation. Tammy was delightful to collaborate with and it was
          evident she could do so much more than organize. Tammy is now a
          “favorite” in my contacts!”

          “I had the pleasure of working with Tammy when she organized the desk
          and shelving area adjacent to my kitchen. This area had bothered me
          for years, and although I had tried to solve the problem myself, I
          couldn’t find a system that worked; it always turned back into a
          disorganized mess. Once Tammy assessed the problem, she was able to
          come up with new systems for organizing the space. Now, more than a
          year later, the area still functions well and is neat and organized.
          I’m also still thrilled whenever I open the adorable battery organizer
          that she found and labeled for me.”

          “Tammy's sweet enthusiastic efficiency made the daunting task of
          clearing out an overcrowded disorganized home office possible. We now
          have an office that works for everyone in the house, and I was setting
          up my next appointment for the garage before she walked out the
          door..”
