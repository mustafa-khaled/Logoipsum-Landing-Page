        <h2>The Box</h2>
        <p>
          As a professional organizer, I rely on systems to get the job done
          efficiently. The best system I have created requires thinking INSIDE
          the box. No matter the space, room, collection, etcâ€”I can
          compartmentalize it in a series of boxes to create a fool-proof system
          for you and your family.
          <br /> Box Systems: school memory box and family box (including a mail
          drop, file and shred file). Feel free to inquire within!
