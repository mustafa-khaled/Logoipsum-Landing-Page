        <h2>Closet Styling</h2>
        <p>
          Same as the above with an emphasis on STYLE. Take a look at this
          stunning closet reveal to see what I mean…see closet

        <h2>Kitchen/Pantry</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine all of your spices in simple, modern, and uniform containers
          all ready for you to live out your Michelin rated cooking experience.
          Imagine a clearly labeled and stocked pantry. Book now and you don’t
          have to imagine it anymore.

        <h2>Office</h2>
        <p>
          Everybody has paper clutter and nobody knows what to do with it! You
          stare at it and it magically builds up—and it’s paralyzing! Take a
          deep breath because you are not alone! I am well-versed in the
          tackling of paper clutter and organizing offices is actually one of my
          top services employed. Whether it is a home or corporate office, you
          are in good hands.

        <h2>Kids/Playroom</h2>
        <p>
          Kids come with their own subset of unpredictability. I am here to help
          eliminate one variable: where do their clothes, books, and toys go.
          Unfortunately, the rest is up to you.

        <h2>Garage</h2>
        <p>
          The garage should not be the resting place for the items you just no
          longer want to address. It is a place for your vehicle, seasonal
          items, and your hobbies! And sometimes spiders.

      <div>
        <h2>Moving</h2>
        <p>
          You know: the thing that nobody likes doing. The process that starts
          off with order and then ends with one throwing everything in a “junk”
          drawer. NOT TODAY, MY FRIENDS! Schedule me before your next move and I
          can have you ready to work in your home office or ready to cook in
          your kitchen on the first night!

      <div>
        <h2>Refresh</h2>
        <p>
          This service is ideal for former clients who just need a simple
          refresh in their space. Think of it like an organizational reset
          button! Some clients like to Refresh before school starts or after the
          holidays. Who couldn’t use a little reset?
